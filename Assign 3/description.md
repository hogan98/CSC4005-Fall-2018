Write a sequential program, a P-thread, and an MPI parallel programs to simulate an astronomical N-body system, but in two-dimensions.
The bodies are initially at rest.  Their initial positions and masses are to be selected randomly (using a random number generator).  
Display the movement of the bodies using xlib, or other GUI systems.
